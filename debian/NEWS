gunicorn (19.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  The /etc/gunicorn.d (and related usr/sbin/gunicorn{,3}-debian) scripts were
  removed in 19.6.0-3 due to inflexibility, lack of documentation, not
  adopted/supported upstream, did not work with virtualenvs, etc.

  They were dropped prior to the stretch release to avoid having to support it
  for another full release.

  Users relying on this feature should invoke gunicorn manually. For an example
  systemd .service file, please see the ``gunicorn-mysite.service`` file in the
  gunicorn-examples package or a process manager such as runit, etc.
